<h2>Exercise ISV
/
Introduction to spatial visualization&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
  <li>To gain exposure to a wide
variety of styles of presentation and interaction with spatial
information; &nbsp;</li>
  <li>To explore your opinions on
these spatial "visualizations" and begin&nbsp;to identify the
reasons
behind those opinions;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To listen critically to
other's opinions on spatial visualizations.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3>In a nutshell...</h3>
<p>Your task is survey different
types of "spatial visualizations" you can find on the Web, and report
back to the class about an example that particularly interests
you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The fine print...</h3>
<p>You should complete this
exercise in groups of 3 or 4 students. You may decide on your groups amongst yourselves, or else you will be allocated to a group. Many of the practicals will operate in groups, so you will have a chance to get to know your group members over the coming two weeks. </p>
<p>You can split your task
  into two stages.</p>
<h4>Stage 1: Web search and
analysis</h4>
<p>Search the Web for examples of
as many different "spatial visualizations" as you can find. These might
include maps, animations,
GIS interfaces, graphics from news articles or blogs, or indeed any
form of presentation of geographic information (images, videos,
software, etc.). One example to start
you off is the Empires Decline Revisited* by&nbsp;Pedro Miguel
Cruz, <a href="http://vimeo.com/11506746">http://vimeo.com/11506746</a>.
As you find more, try to identify similar and dissimilar examples,
construct a tentative classification of types of spatial
visualization.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Stage 2:&nbsp;Share and report back on your results</h4>
<p>You should upload links to the best examples you find in your group blog site. Select one of your examples
which you particularly like (or dislike) and prepare to briefly present
that example to the class, explaining what it is about your example you
(dis)like. You should be ready to answer questions about your
reasons.&nbsp;Have a look at other groups blog sites, and feel free to give (constructive) comments and feedback on your own views of the examples others post. </p>
