<h2>Exercise
DGC / Critiquing data graphics</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
  <li>To gain experience of the
different types of data graphics commonly
encountered; &nbsp;</li>
  <li>To critically assess
data graphics;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To practice your
presentation skills and team work.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3>In a nutshell...</h3>
<p>Your task is, in your groups,
to seek out a variety of interesting or thought-provoking data graphics, and critically analyze these. You will report
back to the class by sharing your data results on your group blog and presenting to the class the best and worst
instance you found, explaining your analysis to the class, and be
prepared to answer questions on your chosen instances.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The fine print...</h3>
<p>You should complete this
exercise in your groups of 3 or 4 people. You can split your task
into three stages.</p>
<h4>Stage 1: Collect and collate a
  corpus of data graphics</h4>
<p>Use your resourcefulness to
find and survey a small corpus of
data graphics. You may find it useful to visit the library, to
read the papers, browse the magazines in your local newsagent, or
simply look around your home or classroom, as well as of course search
the Internet. </p>
<h4>Stage 2: Critically analyze
your corpus&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Critically assess your corpus,
using the visual variables (and related topics) covered in lectures so far. From your analysis, identify the one of the&nbsp;best
and
one of the worst data graphics in your corpus, and refine your
analysis as necessary. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Stage 3: Share your
findings&nbsp;</h4>
<p>You must upload links to a selection of your
best/worst graphics to your group Blog, along with a brief (&lt;100
word)
explanation of your analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selected groups must also orally present
findings to the whole class. Each
group will have at most 4 minutes briefly to present either their best
or worst interface/graphics and to summarize their analysis and
justifications for the choice. You will be able to access your
graphic/interface via the Wiki (no powerpoint, no bullet points). You
should be prepared to answer questions on your choices and analysis, as
well as support other presenters by asking questions about their
choices.</p>
<p>At the end, we shall hold a
class vote on the overall best and worst
interface and graphic. </p>
