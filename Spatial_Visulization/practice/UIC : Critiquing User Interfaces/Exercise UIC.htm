<h2>Exercise
UIC / Critiquing user interfaces</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
  <li>To gain experience of the many different types of interfaces we encounter every day;</li>
  <li>To critically assess
the user interfaces you encounter;</li>
  <li>To gain experience with mapping and sharing geographic data with the class; and&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To practice your
presentation skills and team work.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3>In a nutshell...</h3>
<p>In small groups,
your task is to seek out on the campus examples of good and bad user 
interfaces. These might be anything from on-campus maps and signage, to 
doors, telephones, paths, or other objects. You must  take a photo of 
your chosen object, note its coordinates, and upload your picture along 
with a brief explanation of your choice to a class map. </p>
<h3>The fine print...</h3>
<p>You should complete this
exercise in your groups of 3 or 4 people. You can then split your task
into four stages.</p>
<h4>Stage 1: Identify good and bad interfaces on campus</h4>
<p>In your groups, you should explore the university campus and not any 
examples of good or bad interfaces you come across. Any type of user 
interface is acceptable, from maps or signage, to doors or windows, to 
photocopier or telephones. You should identify at least two good and two
 bad interface examples, preferably outside. You should use the 
principles of interface design covered in the lectures in determining 
whether you think a particular interface is good or bad. </p>
<h4>Stage 2: Capture data about your interfaces</h4>
<p>You will need to generate the following information about your chosen interface examples: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A photograph of your example: You should photograph your example 
interface and upload it to the course web site, giving it a suitable 
name. You will need to make your photo public ("Permit anyone") to make 
it accessible to all. Note the URL of your photo. </li>
  <li>The lat/long location of your example: You will need to record the
 coordinate location of your example interface. It is up to you to 
determine how to find the coordinate location. There are many websites 
and apps that can help with this task. </li>
  <li>Your critique: You should generate a brief summary of why you 
chose your interface as a good/bad example, with reference to the 
principles of good interface design covered in class. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Stage 3: Map your results</h4>
<p>You must create a map of your
  examples of good and bad interfaces. There are a variety of different 
systems you can use, such as Mapbox (http://mapbox.com).&nbsp;You should
 then upload the data about your examples to your map, including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A marker at the point on the campus where your example can be found; </li>
  <li>A brief title indicating what the interface is and whether you chose it as a good or bad example; </li>
  <li>Your image of the interface and your brief explanation of your critique within the description for the marker. </li>
  </ul>
<p>In Mapbox, there are a number of ways to upload your data, either 
manually from the Mapbox interface or via generating and uploading 
GeoJSON files. Note that you can include HTML &lt;img&gt; tags within 
your marker description. </p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<p>The image below, drawn from the Mapbox map at <a href="https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/mduckham.i9dajmdm/page.html#13/-35.3333/149.0676">https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/mduckham.i9dajmdm/page.html#13/-35.3333/149.0676</a> shows an example of a particularly bad interface (a tap) in a government building in Canberra. </p>

<h4>Stage 4: Share your
  findings&nbsp;</h4>
<p>You should make the URL of your map available via your group blog in order for others to see your chosen interfaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selected groups must also orally present
findings to the whole class. Each
group will have at most 5 minutes briefly to present either their best
or worst interfaces and to summarize their analysis and
justifications for the choice. You will be able to access your
map (no powerpoint, no bullet points). You
should be prepared to answer questions on your choices and analysis, as
well as support other presenters by asking question about their
choices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end, we shall hold a
class vote on the overall best and worst
interface. </p>
