<h2>Assignment 2: Processing interface  (Assessed)</h2>
<h3>In a nutshell...</h3>
<p>Your task is to develop in Processing an interface that allows the user to view (and possibly explore) socio-economic data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to plan the future locations of government schools in an area of Australia. Your principle dataset will be the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) dataset from 2011 (the latest available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in September 2016). Your audience (users) are employees of the Australia Government's Department of Education and Training who work closely with the State Government's Education Department responsible for government schools in your chosen geographic area. Your interface should be intuitive and easy to use, carefully designed and help users to view the different indexes within a spatial context.</p>
<p>Note, the focus of this assignment is to create an <b>interface</b> to the SEIFA dataset in your chosen geographic area. You are <i>not</i> expected to perform any in depth data modelling, although data selection may be an important part of the design process to ensure that only relevant data is available to the user.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>This exercise is to be completed individually. </p>
<p>The assessment is worth 20% of your final subject mark. </p>
<p>You must submit through LMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully commented and working Processing sketch for your interface, submitted as a .zip file of your sketch folder; and</li>
<li>A pdf file containing the following:</li>
<ol>
<li>A one-page summary of your design,</li>
<li>An appendix that clearly describes all of the sources used in your design.</li>
</ol></ul>
<p>You must use the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) data from 2011 as your primary dataset, which is provided on LMS (can also be downloaded from the ABS website, refer links below). You may incorporate additional datasets if they suitably support the interface's purpose of planning future government school locations.</p>
<p>The degree to which your interface ranges from presentation to exploration of the dataset is up to you. This is addressed in terms of technical and design innovation in the Assessment Criteria below.</p>
<p>In your one-page summary you are free to provide extra information about your design to highlight any background work, or to assist the user in understanding and/or using your interface.</p>
<p>The submission deadline is clearly stated on LMS. <b>No late submissions will be accepted</b>. This means submissions after the stated deadline will not be marked and will receive a mark of zero.</p>
<h3>Assessment Criteria</h3>
<p>The key assessment criteria are (out of 100):</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission: The submission is in the correct formats, the Processing code works when run on the marker's machine, contains any the necessary data and files, and conforms with all the submission criteria above (10). </li>
<li>Design and design summary: The interface and graphics conforms to basic graphic/map/interface design principles covered in class, and are well-presented with evidence of care and attention to detail (40). </li>
<li>Technical challenge: E.g., the interface relies on new or different programming techniques not encountered in class; has particularly compact, well-structured, or well-presented code; and/or demonstrates clear evidence of advanced and independent work (25).    </li>
<li>Design innovation: E.g., the interface involves design elements that are innovative (e.g., beyond standard elements available in a GIS or spreadsheet); reveals patterns; is notably aesthetically pleasing or striking; demonstrates independent background research into associated literature, beyond simply reusing ideas from existing solutions; and/or existing demonstrates clear evidence of original thinking and advanced understanding of map, interface, and design principles (25). </li>
</ul>
<p>As a guide to grade-related criteria: </p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;50: <span style="font-style: italic;">Inadequate work</span> that in one or more respects fails to meet basic technical standards or apply basic design principles.</li>
<li>50-60: <span style="font-style: italic;">Satisfactory work</span> that is a correctly submitted basic interface to the data for presentation purposes using basic visual variables.</li>
<li>60-70: <span style="font-style: italic;">Good work</span> that involves marginal additional technical challenge such as increased interactivity (e.g. displaying multiple data layers), marginal design innovation and moderate levels of design quality. </li>
<li>70-80: <span style="font-style: italic;">Excellent work</span> that involves clear additional technical challenge such as greater interactivity (e.g., tools allowing the user to explore the dataset) or design innovation (e.g. animated visual variables), and high levels of design quality. </li>
<li>&gt;80: <span style="font-style: italic;">Outstanding work</span> that demonstrates substantial additional technical challenge, substantial design innovation, flawless design, and involves work that clearly goes beyond that normally expected in class.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>Think carefully about your use of visual variables and enumeration units. These have been key discussion points in many lectures.</li>
<li>Match the currency of the SEIFA data to corresponding geographic boundaries.</li>
<li>Be sure to use necessary map elements in your interface design.</li>
<li>You may use additional Processing libraries to help with your interface. However, if you use other non-standard libraries, your code may not work on the marker's machine and your submission and consequently will be heavily penalized. If you use additional standard Processing libraries, you must add clear comments in your code before any "include" statements to identify the name of each Processing library required. Failure to clearly document what libraries are required to run your interface will also lead to loss of marks.</li>
<li>Your summary and interface must be carefully designed. If your interface requires a page of dense text to explain, it is unlikely that the interface itself is well-designed. Thus, it is not recommended that you use the design summary for more than the briefest explanation of how to use your interface: if the interface requires a long or detailed explanation for its use then it is, by implication, not well-designed. Note, your design summary will be assessed in part based on <em>its </em>design. You should take care to ensure the design summary is carefully presented with attention to detail. For example, you may prefer to simply have a diagram as your design summary, instead of text.</li>
<li>You should carefully read the ABS website's information on SEIFA and its measures. Be sure not to use the wrong visual variables in your design.</li>
<li>Use of QGIS, ESRI ArcMap or PostGIS is strongly encouraged if your datasets require formatting.</li>
<li>Note, there are many existing methods to visualise ABS data on the web, but these may not be for SEIFA data. You are welcome to refer to these resources and even reuse existing ideas (with adequate acknowledgments, see section on Plagiarism below). However, the highest marks for this assessment can only be accessed if your interface demonstrates significant design innovation.</li>
<li>Spelling and grammar are part of the assessment. Your design summary and code commenting should exhibit attention to detail, and should be free of errors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Plagiarism</h3>
<p>Plagiarism is copying and use of another‘s work without proper acknowledgment. The university has a clear policy prohibiting any form of plagiarism. Further information can be found at: http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/plagiarism/.</p>
<p>Note that it is acceptable to reuse ideas and code you have found on the web <i>as long as the source is clearly acknowledged, and that use is permitted by any license restrictions</i>. If properly acknowledged, using other people's code and ideas can count as independent background research (see grade related criteria above). If not properly acknowledged, using other people's code and ideas is plagiarism and will result in a mark of zero for this assessment. In serious cases plagiarism may also result in failure of the entire subject and further University disciplinary action.</p>
<p>In short: <b>you must clearly acknowledge any material that you used in your submission within your appendix</b>. </p>
