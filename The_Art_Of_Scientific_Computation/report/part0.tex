\section{Introduction}
Our program is a stereo vision program. Till now, we build a calibration model, which can build a 3D model through two images taken by a pair of cameras.

\section{Outline of extension}
In fact, I have great interests in artificial intelligence. I think maybe we can build a computer vision system to generate a right eye's scene from a left image. If training datasets is big enough, this should be a very easy task. But what about 3D model. Can computer vision system generate a 3D model? At least today's computer vision related research have not extend to 3D, if we can build a rudiment of it, it might be a great progress.

\section{What I hope to learn}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For a computer science student. I want to improve my coding ability in matlab, which may gives me more oppertunities in future's job matket and gives me possibility to do computing related research.
	\item I want learn more about 3D vision. We live in a 3D world, I think the main part of computer vision will one day become 3D vision, so our program is a frontier research.
	\item The most essential  part a man is ideas. I want to learn more varient way of thinking from the optimisation parts of the projects.
\end{itemize}
